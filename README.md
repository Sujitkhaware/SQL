SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to perform various operations on databases, including:

Data Retrieval: SQL queries can retrieve data from one or more database tables using commands like SELECT.

Data Manipulation: SQL supports commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE for adding, modifying, and removing data from database tables.

Data Definition: SQL can define the structure of databases and tables using commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.

SQL queries are written using a syntax defined by the SQL standard, and they can be executed against a wide range of database management systems (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and SQLite.
